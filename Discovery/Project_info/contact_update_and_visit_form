Below are instructions for completing a foreign national visit request.  
I've attached a redacted example of the letter that was used last semester. 
Attached to the letter were color copies of their passport photo page and student visa.

Local Foreign Visits to include permanent residents, a.k.a.
green card holders can only be a one time visit, not to exceed 30 days.
The foreign national must submit a letter with a copy of their passport 
(if dual citizenship representing a foreign entity, provide copies of both passports)
and permanent resident, a.k.a. green card each time they visit.

This request letter can be faxed to the NVESD Security Office at (703) 704-3241 (unclassified),
or emailed by the sponsoring POC to the NVESD Foreign Disclosure Officer. Letters should be received at 
least 5 business days prior to visit date to allow for processing.

The company/university who employs/sponsors the visitor(s) must provide on corporate letterhead 
(with a physical corporate address, (post office boxes will not be accepted)) the following information:
•Visitor's Full name
•Date and Place of Birth
•Country(s) of Citizenship
•Passport Number(s)
•Visa Number
•Permanent Resident Card Number (a.k.a Green Card)
•Government Contract Number (if applicable)
•Program Title (if applicable)
•Purpose of Visit (be specific)
•Government POC's name and phone number
•Date(s) of visit
•Legible copy of the passport (preferably a PDF copy)
•Legible copy of the Visa (preferably a PDF copy)
•Legible copy of the permanent resident, a.k.a green card (preferably a PDF copy)
•A statement from the sponsoring organization accepting full responsibility for the foreign national while in the compound; signed by a corporate officer.
